# @fission-ai/duowenspec

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#747](https://github.com/zxcrf/DuownSpec) [`1e94443`](https://github.com/zxcrf/DuownSpec) Thanks [@TabishB](https://github.com/zxcrf/DuownSpec)! - ### New Features

  - **Profile system** — Choose between `core` (4 essential workflows) and `custom` (pick any subset) profiles to control which skills get installed. Manage profiles with the new `duowenspec config profile` command
  - **Propose workflow** — New one-step workflow creates a complete change proposal with design, specs, and tasks from a single request — no need to run `new` then `ff` separately
  - **AI tool auto-detection** — `duowenspec init` now scans your project for existing tool directories (`.claude/`, `.cursor/`, etc.) and pre-selects detected tools
  - **Pi (pi.dev) support** — Pi coding agent is now a supported tool with prompt and skill generation
  - **Kiro support** — AWS Kiro IDE is now a supported tool with prompt and skill generation
  - **Sync prunes deselected workflows** — `duowenspec update` now removes command files and skill directories for workflows you've deselected, keeping your project clean
  - **Config drift warning** — `duowenspec config list` warns when global config is out of sync with the current project

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed onboard preflight giving a false "not initialized" error on freshly initialized projects
  - Fixed archive workflow stopping mid-way when syncing — it now properly resumes after sync completes
  - Added Windows PowerShell alternatives for onboard shell commands

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- [#578](https://github.com/zxcrf/DuownSpec) [`0cc9d90`](https://github.com/zxcrf/DuownSpec) Thanks [@TabishB](https://github.com/zxcrf/DuownSpec)! - ## DuowenSpec 1.0 — The OPSX Release

  The workflow has been rebuilt from the ground up. OPSX replaces the old phase-locked `/duowenspec:*` commands with an action-based system where AI understands what artifacts exist, what's ready to create, and what each action unlocks.

  ### Breaking Changes

  - **Old commands removed** — `/duowenspec:proposal`, `/duowenspec:apply`, and `/duowenspec:archive` no longer exist
  - **Config files removed** — Tool-specific instruction files (`CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `AGENTS.md`, `project.md`) are no longer generated
  - **Migration** — Run `duowenspec init` to upgrade. Legacy artifacts are detected and cleaned up with confirmation.

  ### From Static Prompts to Dynamic Instructions

  **Before:** AI received the same static instructions every time, regardless of project state.

  **Now:** Instructions are dynamically assembled from three layers:

  1. **Context** — Project background from `config.yaml` (tech stack, conventions)
  2. **Rules** — Artifact-specific constraints (e.g., "propose spike tasks for unknowns")
  3. **Template** — The actual structure for the output file

  AI queries the CLI for real-time state: which artifacts exist, what's ready to create, what dependencies are satisfied, and what each action unlocks.

  ### From Phase-Locked to Action-Based

  **Before:** Linear workflow — proposal → apply → archive. Couldn't easily go back or iterate.

  **Now:** Flexible actions on a change. Edit any artifact anytime. The artifact graph tracks state automatically.

  | Command              | What it does                                         |
  | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
  | `/dwsp:explore`      | Think through ideas before committing to a change    |
  | `/dwsp:new`          | Start a new change                                   |
  | `/dwsp:continue`     | Create one artifact at a time (step-through)         |
  | `/dwsp:ff`           | Create all planning artifacts at once (fast-forward) |
  | `/dwsp:apply`        | Implement tasks                                      |
  | `/dwsp:verify`       | Validate implementation matches artifacts            |
  | `/dwsp:sync`         | Sync delta specs to main specs                       |
  | `/dwsp:archive`      | Archive completed change                             |
  | `/dwsp:bulk-archive` | Archive multiple changes with conflict detection     |
  | `/dwsp:onboard`      | Guided 15-minute walkthrough of complete workflow    |

  ### From Text Merging to Semantic Spec Syncing

  **Before:** Spec updates required manual merging or wholesale file replacement.

  **Now:** Delta specs use semantic markers that AI understands:

  - `## ADDED Requirements` — New requirements to add
  - `## MODIFIED Requirements` — Partial updates (add scenario without copying existing ones)
  - `## REMOVED Requirements` — Delete with reason and migration notes
  - `## RENAMED Requirements` — Rename preserving content

  Archive parses these at the requirement level, not brittle header matching.

  ### From Scattered Files to Agent Skills

  **Before:** 8+ config files at project root + slash commands scattered across 21 tool-specific locations with different formats.

  **Now:** Single `.claude/skills/` directory with YAML-fronted markdown files. Auto-detected by Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf. Cross-editor compatible.

  ### New Features

  - **Onboarding skill** — `/dwsp:onboard` walks new users through their first complete change with codebase-aware task suggestions and step-by-step narration (11 phases, ~15 minutes)

  - **21 AI tools supported** — Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf, Continue, Gemini CLI, GitHub Copilot, Amazon Q, Cline, RooCode, Kilo Code, Auggie, CodeBuddy, Qoder, Qwen, CoStrict, Crush, Factory, OpenCode, Antigravity, iFlow, and Codex

  - **Interactive setup** — `duowenspec init` shows animated welcome screen and searchable multi-select for choosing tools. Pre-selects already-configured tools for easy refresh.

  - **Customizable schemas** — Define custom artifact workflows in `duowenspec/schemas/` without touching package code. Teams can share workflows via version control.

  ### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed Claude Code YAML parsing failure when command names contained colons
  - Fixed task file parsing to handle trailing whitespace on checkbox lines
  - Fixed JSON instruction output to separate context/rules from template — AI was copying constraint blocks into artifact files

  ### Documentation

  - New getting-started guide, CLI reference, concepts documentation
  - Removed misleading "edit mid-flight and continue" claims that weren't implemented
  - Added migration guide for upgrading from pre-OPSX versions

  **Bug Fixes**

  - Shell completions now correctly offer parent-level flags (like `--help`) when a command has subcommands
  - Fixed Windows compatibility issues in tests

  **Other**

  - Added optional anonymous usage statistics to help understand how DuowenSpec is used. This is **opt-out** by default – set `DUOWENSPEC_TELEMETRY=0` or `DO_NOT_TRACK=1` to disable. Only command names and version are collected; no arguments, file paths, or content. Automatically disabled in CI environments.

## 0.18.0

## 0.17.2

### Patch Changes

- 455c65f: Fix `--no-interactive` flag in validate command to properly disable spinner, preventing hangs in pre-commit hooks and CI environments

## 0.17.1

### Patch Changes

- a2757e7: Fix pre-commit hook hang issue in config command by using dynamic import for @inquirer/prompts

  The config command was causing pre-commit hooks to hang indefinitely due to stdin event listeners being registered at module load time. This fix converts the static import to a dynamic import that only loads inquirer when the `config reset` command is actually used interactively.

  Also adds ESLint with a rule to prevent static @inquirer imports, avoiding future regressions.
