# Implementation Tasks

## 1. Add Nix Installation to CI

- [x] 1.1 Research Nix installation options for GitHub Actions (nix-installer-action vs manual install)
- [x] 1.2 Add Nix installation step to .github/workflows/ci.yml
- [x] 1.3 Configure Nix with experimental features enabled (flakes, nix-command)
- [x] 1.4 Add Nix store caching to improve CI performance

## 2. Create Nix Build Validation Job

- [x] 2.1 Add new `nix-flake-validate` job to .github/workflows/ci.yml
- [x] 2.2 Implement `nix build` step with proper error handling
- [x] 2.3 Add verification step to confirm binary exists in build output
- [x] 2.4 Add step to test binary execution (`nix run . -- --version`)

## 3. Add Update Script Validation

- [x] 3.1 Add job step to run scripts/update-flake.sh in dry-run or test mode
- [x] 3.2 Verify script executes without errors
- [x] 3.3 Add validation that version is correctly extracted from package.json
- [x] 3.4 Verify flake.nix is updated with correct format (version and hash)

## 4. Configure Job Dependencies and Requirements

- [x] 4.1 Configure Nix validation job to run on pull_request and push events
- [x] 4.2 Add Nix validation to required checks list
- [x] 4.3 Configure job to run in parallel with existing test/lint jobs
- [x] 4.4 Set appropriate timeout (5-10 minutes)

## 5. Test with act Locally

- [x] 5.1 Install act locally if not already available
- [x] 5.2 Test Nix validation job using `act pull_request`
- [x] 5.3 Verify act can run the workflow with Nix installed
- [x] 5.4 Document any act-specific configuration needed in .actrc or README

## 6. Documentation and Finalization

- [x] 6.1 Add documentation about Nix CI validation to README or CONTRIBUTING.md
- [x] 6.2 Document how to test CI locally with act
- [ ] 6.3 Update CI badge or status indicators if needed
- [ ] 6.4 Test end-to-end by creating a test PR

## 7. Archive Change

- [x] 7.1 After merge and verification, create new spec file at duowenspec/specs/ci-nix-validation/spec.md
- [x] 7.2 Move change directory to duowenspec/changes/archive/[date]-add-nix-ci-validation/
- [x] 7.3 Run `duowenspec validate --strict` to confirm archived change passes
