# Add Init Command for DuowenSpec

## Why

Projects need a simple way to adopt DuowenSpec conventions. Currently, users must manually create the directory structure and understand all the conventions, which creates friction for adoption. An init command would enable instant DuowenSpec setup with proper structure and guidance.

## What Changes

- Add `duowenspec init` CLI command that creates the complete DuowenSpec directory structure
- Generate template files (README.md with AI instructions, project.md template)
- Interactive prompt to select which AI tools to configure (Claude Code initially, others marked as "coming soon")
- Support for multiple AI coding assistants with extensible plugin architecture
- Smart file updates using content markers to preserve existing configurations
- Custom directory naming with `--dir` flag
- Validation to prevent overwriting existing DuowenSpec structures
- Clear error messages with helpful guidance (e.g., suggesting 'duowenspec update' for existing structures)
- Display actionable next steps after successful initialization
