## Why
- Codex (the VS Code extension formerly known as Codeium Chat) exposes "slash commands" by reading Markdown prompt files from `~/.codex/prompts/`. Each file name becomes the `/command` users can run, with YAML frontmatter for metadata (`description`, `argument-hint`) and `$ARGUMENTS` to capture user input. The workflow screenshot shared by Kevin Kern ("Codex problem analyzer") shows the format DuowenSpec should target so teams can invoke curated workflows straight from the chat palette.
- Teams already rely on DuowenSpec to manage the slash-command surface area for Claude, Cursor, OpenCode, Kilo Code, and Windsurf. Leaving Codex out forces them to manually copy/paste DuowenSpec guardrails into `~/.codex/prompts/*.md`, which drifts quickly and undermines the "single source of truth" promise of the CLI.
- Codex commands live outside the repository (under the user's home directory), so shipping an automated configurator that both scaffolds the prompts and keeps them refreshed via `duowenspec update` eliminates error-prone manual steps and keeps DuowenSpec instructions synchronized across assistants.

## What Changes
- Add Codex to the `duowenspec init` tool picker with the same "already configured" detection we use for other editors, wiring an implementation that writes managed Markdown prompts directly to Codex's global directory (`~/.codex/prompts` or `$CODEX_HOME/prompts`) with DuowenSpec marker blocks.
- Produce three Codex prompt files—`duowenspec-proposal.md`, `duowenspec-apply.md`, and `duowenspec-archive.md`—whose content mirrors the shared slash-command templates while using YAML frontmatter (`description` and `argument-hint` fields) and `$ARGUMENTS` to capture all arguments as a single string (matching the GitHub Copilot pattern and official Codex specification).
- Document Codex's global-only discovery and that DuowenSpec writes prompts directly to `~/.codex/prompts` (or `$CODEX_HOME/prompts`).
- Teach `duowenspec update` to refresh existing Codex prompts in-place (and only when they already exist) in the global directory, updating both frontmatter and body.
- Document Codex support alongside other slash-command integrations and add regression coverage that exercises init/update behaviour against a temporary global prompts directory via `CODEX_HOME`.

## Impact
- Specs: `cli-init`, `cli-update`
- Code: `src/core/config.ts`, `src/core/configurators/slash/*`, `src/core/templates/slash-command-templates.ts`, CLI tool summaries, docs
- Tests: integration coverage for Codex prompt scaffolding and refresh logic
- Docs: README and CHANGELOG entries announcing Codex slash-command support

## Current Spec Reference
- `specs/cli-init/spec.md`
  - Requirements cover init UX, directory scaffolding, AI tool configuration, and the existing slash-command support for Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode.
  - Our `## MODIFIED` delta in `changes/.../specs/cli-init/spec.md` copies the full "Slash Command Configuration" requirement (header, description, and all scenarios) before appending the new Codex scenario so archiving will retain every prior scenario.
- `specs/cli-update/spec.md`
  - Requirements define update preconditions, template refresh behavior, and slash-command refresh logic for Claude Code, Cursor, and OpenCode.
  - The corresponding delta preserves the entire "Slash Command Updates" requirement while adding the Codex refresh scenario, ensuring the archive workflow replaces the block without losing the existing scenarios or the "Missing slash command file" guardrail.
