## Why

DuowenSpec specifications lack a consistent structure that makes sections visually identifiable and programmatically parseable across different specs. This makes it harder to maintain consistency and build tooling.

## What Changes

**Specification Format Section**
- From: No formal structure requirements for specifications
- To: Structured format with `### Requirement:` and `#### Scenario:` headers
- Reason: Visual consistency and parseability across all specs
- Impact: Non-breaking - existing specs can migrate gradually

**Keyword Formatting**
- From: Inconsistent use of WHEN/THEN/AND keywords
- To: Bold keywords (**WHEN**, **THEN**, **AND**) in scenario bullets
- Reason: Improved readability and consistent visual hierarchy
- Impact: Non-breaking - formatting enhancement only

**Format Flexibility**
- From: Implicit understanding that different content needs different formats
- To: Explicit allowance for alternative formats (OpenAPI, JSON Schema, etc.)
- Reason: Address concern that not all specs fit requirement/scenario pattern
- Impact: Non-breaking - clarifies existing practice

**Migration Guidelines**
- From: No migration guidance
- To: Documented gradual migration approach
- Reason: Allows incremental adoption without disrupting existing specs
- Impact: Non-breaking - opt-in migration as specs are modified

## Impact

- Affected specs: duowenspec-conventions (enhancement to existing capability)
- Affected code: None initially - this is a documentation standard enhancement
- Migration: Gradual - existing specs migrate as they're modified
- Tooling: Enables future parsing tools but doesn't require them
